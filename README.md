# How to run this crap
### Step 1
Download this project using GitHub Dekstop.
### Step 2
Ensure you have python installed on your machine.
Also have a camera connected up to the computer
### Step 3
(Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get everything installed first)
Then in your choice of terminal (I use VS Code's inbuilt one) go `cd PythonFiles` and `python server.py`.
### Step 4
Ensure you have Unity 6000 (latest version when this project was made).
### Step 5
Open up Unity Hub and add a project by selecting the `UnityProject` folder. Then open up the project
### Step 6
If all went well, you should be able to press play and move your head and hands around! (Very optimistic)
